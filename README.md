# Overview

This game is unfinished. Currently, there is a square that you can move with the arrow keys in any 2D direction. You must
navigate through a maze hoping to find the exit. There are torches at dead ends that ignite when you touch them to help guide you.
The goal of the game is to find the exit while lighting the least amount of torches.

I wanted to learn Unity and experiment with what it has to offer.

# Development Environment

I used Unity and Visual Studio Code.

# Future Work

* Limit the player's view
* Make the exit more clear
* Add an end screen with a score based on the number of torches lit
* Create additional levels
